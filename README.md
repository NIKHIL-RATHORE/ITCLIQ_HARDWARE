Mysql database has all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information of Itcliq hardware company. 
I have analysed this database and than hooked it up with Tableau Desktop. 
In Tableau Desktop I performed ETL and data cleaning operations to clean it up so that we can build our dashboard.
Then I built  two powerful interactive dashboard that can help us generate sales insights on business of  Itcliq hardware. 
First one was to give insights about the revenue in different cities on different years whereas the second one Is totally about the profit and margins that we earned.
